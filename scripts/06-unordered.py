"""06-unordered.py

This script provides practice working with unordered collections, 
including sets and dictionaries. 

We get a lot of practice with dictionaries (key-value pairs), 
since we access elements in the document by their id key: 
document["my-id-is-the-key"]

We can do anything we want... animations, drawing with canvas, speech-to-text, 
geolocation...
